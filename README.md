# AppealYourself

Why should you trust shady discord mods to determine your hardcore fate? Appeal yourself! On the spot appeals without time-wasting.

Judgement day has come. Easily play together with all the other software-"hardcore" players, without having to disable your Hardcore addon or edit your WTF folder. :)

Your death is not communicated to others if you so choose, and your tracked time is not diminished. But beware of spies.

## Installation

Just load AppealYourself together with the Hardcore addon, and you can decide on the spot if you were griefed and should be granted an appeal on the spot. You can also trade, use mail and auction house. You just "found" that blue in a chest, right? :D
